      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Rafting has a way to enrich our lives and provide us with great
        adventures. Our goal is to take those experiences and share them with
        our community and fellow rafting lovers. Regardless of the level of
        proficiency, all are welcomed in this family. Share your experiences and
        tips with one another and let us learn together and appreciate the
        beauty found in rafting.

        <!-- The main purpose of this website will be to connect fellow rafting
        lovers. It will be a page in which people can share their love for the
        sport and even get together for socials. There will be a space for
        people who are also interested in learning more about rafting and
        participating in activities with the group. Another portion of the
        website will be availbale for people to request our services and
        buy/rent equipament. -->
      </p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        We are focused on helping our rafters create a sense of community and
        provide those experiences for this group. Also, we are opened for those
        who want to try rafting for the first time and with their families.

        <!-- We will be mainly focusing on adults that enjoy rafting and people who
        want to learn more about it. Even though our focus are on adults, we
        will have spots availbales for families as well. Our website will be
        composed of a light bacnground on the colors orange and blue since these
        colors resemble the sun and water. We believe that these colors would
        call their attention. -->
