      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to create a website based on a previous research essay I did for my English class. The research was about the resilience of the mind. The same way we can make our bodies stronger to be better prepared against physical issues, I wanted to understand more of how to strengthen our minds. It was good research that helped me find steps to create this mental resilience. I would like to create a website in which I could share this information with others.  I could also create a space in which people could share their own experiences with their mental health and how the information they found on the website helped them. I love this idea that people can come together to share their unique experiences.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I have always believed that anyone could benefit from this infromation. So my audience is anyone who feels like they are atruggling with their mental health.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Have you ever thought about the fact that 18.5 percent of the adult population in the United States experiences mental illnesses? (Bekiempis, 2014). This means that nearly one in five adults is struggling mentally, and it also means that multiple people we know are facing depression, anxiety, or some kind of mental illness at some level. However, what it is most shocking is the fact that we as a society are afraid of talking about it, and we are afraid of not knowing how to deal with it if either us or someone we know is going through it, and the worst is that we make people feel ashamed for the fact that they experience mental illness. Nevertheless, our minds, just like our bodies, need attention. If we break a bone or have an infection, we go to the doctor; therefore, we should care for our minds the same way. One way we take care of our physical health is by creating resilience. What if we could strengthen our minds by creating this same resilience? In order to develop this resilience of the mind, we must consider three elements that are essential: challenge, commitment, and personal control. As we develop this resilience of the mind, it will help us as our minds are stronger to face mental illnesses and overcome them, it will positively affect our physical help, and help us increase our decision-making ability.

      <p>
        Challenge
      <p>
        Developing the resilience of our minds is a long process in which we must persevere to succeed. According to the research of the psychologist Salvatore Maddi (2006), the first essential element for mental resilience is challenge. He points out that resilient people are those who “see difficulty as a challenge, instead of a paralyzing event” (2006). From time to time, we let ourselves be controlled by the situations we face in our lives, and we cannot move forward to where we want to go. However, creating this resilience means that we are practicing our minds to think differently than what we were used to. This view of difficult situations as a challenge means that we are learning from our mistakes and looking at the problem from different angles to try to solve it instead of just giving up (2006). Are we still allowed to think that something is hard? The answer is a loud YES! We are allowed to feel our emotions. In fact, acknowledging our emotions and feeling them is good for our mental health. Therefore, what we are learning is that we can feel our emotions, but that we have to change the way we view difficult situations because as we see them as challenges that we can overcome, we will stop blaming ourselves for not being able to accomplish them. 
     </p>
     Personal Control
     <p>
     The third element in the process of developing a resilient mind is personal control. This element has to different sides that as the old saying states are two sides of the same coin. On one side, resilient people are those who take control over a situation and are influencing their surroundings. They believe they can make a difference, and they take responsibility for their actions instead of blaming others (Maddi, 2006). On the other side of the coin, they also recognize that there are things which are not over their control, and they do not stress about it or try to control this situation (2006). Frequently, we care too much about the things we are not able to control, and because of that, we start to doubt ourselves, and we become very anxious. We start to believe that others are better because they are able to deal with the situations in their lives while we cannot. However, the truth is that we all have things we cannot control such as other people’s opinions, the weather, how much homework you have. We can only control how we act and think and knowing this helps us have a stronger sense of self-worth and become a person who controls the situation instead of someone who is controlled by the situation.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Commitment
      <p>
        Commitment is the second essential element for a resilient mind. Resilient minds are those which are committed to their lives. Committing is not just restricted to work or school, but it also means committing to relationships with family and friends, to causes that one cares about, to religion and spiritual beliefs (Maddi, 2006). Committing ourselves to the life around us will give us a reason to wake up in the morning, helping our minds to become stronger because we will feel that we have a purpose. Feeling that you have a purpose is one of the things that people who face mental challenges most often struggle with. They often feel that there is nothing left to do. That is why committing to ourselves, to our lives, and to those around us is a key point to develop this resilience. By committing, we help ourselves to find purpose and perseverance. It is a lot easier to fight for something when you know what and why you are fighting for (2006). Therefore, there will be an increase on success for someone as they keep fighting against any illnesses if they understand what they are fighting against and the reasons why they are fighting for. It is in this moment that the person fighting needs to be surrounded by those who love him or her, because they will have at least one reason why they are fighting, and that they are not fighting alone. 
        </p>
        Connection
      <p>
        As human beings we have a need for connection. We might not realize it or understand what it is, but that need is always there. When we feel accepted and part of a group, our self-esteem increases. In a world in which technology advances, more and more people tend to think that by just texting someone or sending them an email tat connection need will be fulfilled. This is not true. We need face-to-face interactions, we need to give each other long hugs, and feel that we are important to someone. Feeling that there are people who care about us helps us feel needed and gives us the strength to continue on. This is the power that connection will bring to our lives
