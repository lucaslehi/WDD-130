            Have you ever thought about the fact that 18.5 percent of the adult
            population in the United States experiences mental illnesses?
            (Bekiempis, 2014). This means that nearly one in five adults is
            struggling mentally, and it also means that multiple people we know
            are facing depression, anxiety, or some kind of mental illness at
            some level. However, what it is most shocking is the fact that we as
            a society are afraid of talking about it, and we are afraid of not
            knowing how to deal with it if either us or someone we know is going
            through it, and the worst is that we make people feel ashamed for
            the fact that they experience mental illness. Nevertheless, our
            minds, just like our bodies, need attention. If we break a bone or
            have an infection, we go to the doctor; therefore, we should care
            for our minds the same way. One way we take care of our physical
            health is by creating resilience. What if we could strengthen our
            minds by creating this same resilience? In order to develop this
            resilience of the mind, we must consider three elements that are
            essential: challenge, commitment, and personal control. As we
            develop this resilience of the mind, it will help us as our minds
            are stronger to face mental illnesses and overcome them, it will
            positively affect our physical help, and help us increase our
            decision-making ability.
