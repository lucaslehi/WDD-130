            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Have you ever thought about the fact that 18.5
            percent of the adult population in the United States experiences
            mental illnesses? (Bekiempis, 2014). This means that nearly one in
            five adults is struggling mentally, and it also means that multiple
            people we know are facing depression, anxiety, or some kind of
            mental illness at some level.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, what is most shocking is the fact that we
            as a society are afraid of talking about it. We are afraid of not
            knowing how to deal with it if either us or someone we know is going
            through it, and the worst is that we make people feel ashamed for
            the fact that they experience mental illness.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nevertheless, our minds, just like our bodies,
            need attention. If we break a bone or have an infection, we go to
            the doctor; therefore, we should care for our minds the same way.
            One way we take care of our physical health is by creating
            resilience.<br />

            >What if we could strengthen our minds by creating this same
            resilience?</strong
          ><br />
          <p></p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In order to develop this resilience of the mind, we
          must consider three elements that are essential: challenge,
          commitment, and personal control. As we develop this resilience of the
          mind, it will help us as our minds are stronger to face mental
          illnesses and overcome them, it will positively affect our physical
          help, and help us increase our decision-making ability.
