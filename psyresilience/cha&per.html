            Developing the resilience of our minds is a long process in which we must persevere to succeed. According to the research of the psychologist Salvatore Maddi (2006), the first essential element for mental resilience is challenge. He points out that resilient people are those who “see difficulty as a challenge, instead of a paralyzing event” (2006). From time to time, we let ourselves be controlled by the situations we face in our lives, and we cannot move forward to where we want to go. However, creating this resilience means that we are practicing our minds to think differently than what we were used to. This view of difficult situations as a challenge means that we are learning from our mistakes and looking at the problem from different angles to try to solve it instead of just giving up (2006). Are we still allowed to think that something is hard? The answer is a loud YES! We are allowed to feel our emotions. In fact, acknowledging our emotions and feeling them is good for our mental health. Therefore, what we are learning is that we can feel our emotions, but that we have to change the way we view difficult situations because as we see them as challenges that we can overcome, we will stop blaming ourselves for not being able to accomplish them.          </p>
          <h1>Personal Control</h1>
          <img

          />
          <p class="control-text">
            The third element in the process of developing a resilient mind is personal control. This element has to different sides that as the old saying states are two sides of the same coin. On one side, resilient people are those who take control over a situation and are influencing their surroundings. They believe they can make a difference, and they take responsibility for their actions instead of blaming others (Maddi, 2006). On the other side of the coin, they also recognize that there are things which are not over their control, and they do not stress about it or try to control this situation (2006). Frequently, we care too much about the things we are not able to control, and because of that, we start to doubt ourselves, and we become very anxious. We start to believe that others are better because they are able to deal with the situations in their lives while we cannot. However, the truth is that we all have things we cannot control such as other people’s opinions, the weather, how much homework you have. We can only control how we act and think and knowing this helps us have a stronger sense of self-worth and become a person who controls the situation instead of someone who is controlled by the situation.          </p>
