          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Developing the resilience of our minds is a long
          process in which we must persevere to succeed. According to the
          research of the psychologist Salvatore Maddi (2006), the first
          essential element for mental resilience is challenge. He points out
          that resilient people are those who “see difficulty as a challenge,
          instead of a paralyzing event” (2006).<br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;From time to time, we let ourselves be controlled by
          the situations we face in our lives, and we cannot move forward to
          where we want to go. However, creating this resilience means that we
          are practicing our minds to think differently than what we were used
          to. This view of difficult situations as a challenge means that we are
          learning from our mistakes and looking at the problem from different
          angles to try to solve it instead of just giving up (2006).<br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Are we still allowed to think that something is
          hard? The answer is a loud YES! We are allowed to feel our emotions.
          In fact, acknowledging our emotions and feeling them is good for our
          mental health. Therefore, what we are learning is that we can feel our
          emotions, but that we have to change the way we view difficult
          situations because as we see them as challenges that we can overcome,
          we will stop blaming ourselves for not being able to accomplish them.

      <h1>Commitment</h1>
      <section class="com&con-info">
        <img
          class="commitment-sec"
          src="./img/commitment1.jpg"
          alt="Commitment"
        />
        <p class="commitment-text">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Commitment is the second essential element for a
          resilient mind. Resilient minds are those which are committed to their
          lives. Committing is not just restricted to work or school, but it
          also means committing to relationships with family and friends, to
          causes that one cares about, to religion and spiritual beliefs (Maddi,
          2006).<br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Committing ourselves to the life around us will give
          us a reason to wake up in the morning, helping our minds to become
          stronger because we will feel that we have a purpose. Feeling that you
          have a purpose is one of the things that people who face mental
          challenges most often struggle with. They often feel that there is
          nothing left to do. That is why committing to ourselves, to our lives,
          and to those around us is a key point to develop this resilience.
          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By committing, we help ourselves to find purpose and
          perseverance. It is a lot easier to fight for something when you know
          what and why you are fighting for (2006). Therefore, there will be an
          increase on success for someone as they keep fighting against any
          illnesses if they understand what they are fighting against and the
          reasons why they are fighting for. It is in this moment that the
          person fighting needs to be surrounded by those who love him or her,
          because they will have at least one reason why they are fighting, and
          that they are not fighting alone.
