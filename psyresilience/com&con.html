            Commitment is the second essential element for a resilient mind. Resilient minds are those which are committed to their lives. Committing is not just restricted to work or school, but it also means committing to relationships with family and friends, to causes that one cares about, to religion and spiritual beliefs (Maddi, 2006). Committing ourselves to the life around us will give us a reason to wake up in the morning, helping our minds to become stronger because we will feel that we have a purpose. Feeling that you have a purpose is one of the things that people who face mental challenges most often struggle with. They often feel that there is nothing left to do. That is why committing to ourselves, to our lives, and to those around us is a key point to develop this resilience. By committing, we help ourselves to find purpose and perseverance. It is a lot easier to fight for something when you know what and why you are fighting for (2006). Therefore, there will be an increase on success for someone as they keep fighting against any illnesses if they understand what they are fighting against and the reasons why they are fighting for. It is in this moment that the person fighting needs to be surrounded by those who love him or her, because they will have at least one reason why they are fighting, and that they are not fighting alone.</p>

          <h1>Connection</h1>
          <img
            class="connection-sec"
            src="./img/connection1.jpg"
            alt="connection"
          />
          <p class="connection-text">
            As human beings we have a need for connection. We might not realize it or understand what it is, but that need is always there. When we feel accepted and part of a group, our self-esteem increases. In a world in which technology advances, more and more people tend to think that by just texting someone or sending them an email tat connection need will be fulfilled. This is not true. We need face-to-face interactions, we need to give each other long hugs, and feel that we are important to someone. Feeling that there are people who care about us helps us feel needed and gives us the strength to continue on. This is the power that connection will bring to our lives
