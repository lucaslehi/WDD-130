        <h1>Personal Control</h1>

            class="control-sec"

            The third element in the process of developing a resilient mind is personal control. This element has to different sides that as the old saying states are two sides of the same coin. On one side, resilient people are those who take control over a situation and are influencing their surroundings. They believe they can make a difference, and they take responsibility for their actions instead of blaming others (Maddi, 2006). On the other side of the coin, they also recognize that there are things which are not over their control, and they do not stress about it or try to control this situation (2006). Frequently, we care too much about the things we are not able to control, and because of that, we start to doubt ourselves, and we become very anxious. We start to believe that others are better because they are able to deal with the situations in their lives while we cannot. However, the truth is that we all have things we cannot control such as other peopleâ€™s opinions, the weather, how much homework you have. We can only control how we act and think and knowing this helps us have a stronger sense of self-worth and become a person who controls the situation instead of someone who is controlled by the situation.          </p>
        
          <h1>Connection</h1>
          <img
            class="connection-sec"
            src="./img/connection1.jpg"
            alt="connection"
          />
          <p class="connection-text">
            As human beings we have a need for connection. We might not realize it or understand what it is, but that need is always there. When we feel accepted and part of a group, our self-esteem increases. In a world in which technology advances, more and more people tend to think that by just texting someone or sending them an email tat connection need will be fulfilled. This is not true. We need face-to-face interactions, we need to give each other long hugs, and feel that we are important to someone. Feeling that there are people who care about us helps us feel needed and gives us the strength to continue on. This is the power that connection will bring to our lives
